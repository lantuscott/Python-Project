Hangman Game 

Project Description: 

We have written a hangman game. 

How to run the game: 

To run the game, simply run the Main class. 

Difficulty levels: 

You can select the level of difficulty of the game. The levels to choose from are: 1) Easy: Usually 5 letter words with a minimum of 2 vowels but usually 3 or more vowels, 2) Medium: 7 letter words with usually 2 vowels, and 3) Hard: Short words with zero to one vowel. 

Number of attempts: 

The player will get a maximum of 10 attempts to guess the word. The game will end if the player does not guess the word within 10 attempts, and the player will win the game if guesses the word before using all 10 attempts. 

GUI: 

A GUI (Graphical User Interface) will allow the player to see how many attempts are remaining by the progressive drawing of the hangman parts. The player can also check the progress via the console.  

Console: 

The console will allow the player to enter their guesses (one letter at a time), check the number of attempts used, the number of attempts remaining, and will display the mystery word with the letters that have been guessed correctly.
